## 🔖 What’s Inside This Repository?

This project is made of a few important pieces:

- **`app.py`** → The main web interface (UI) of the app.  
- **`main.py`** → The backend logic: sends your topic to the AI model and returns a blog.  
- **`src/` folder** → Helpful utilities, prompt templates, custom functions, etc.  
- **`langgraph.json`** → (If used) Defines a workflow or chain for the model.  
- **`requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml`** → Lists all Python packages your app needs.

Everything is organized to be easy to read, modify, and extend.
